      <p>
        Lee is colorblind and encounters barriers when shopping online. He has
        one of the most common visual disabilities that affect men: red and
        green color blindness. Lee frequently shops online and sometimes
        encounters problems on websites and with apps where the color contrast
        of text and images is not adequate and where color alone is used to
        indicate required fields and sale prices. When red and green color
        combinations are used, Lee cannot distinguish between the two, since
        both look brown to him. It is also very difficult for him to make
        product choices when color swatches are not labeled with the name of the
        color.

        Alex has worked as a reporter for more than 20 years and has developed a
        repetitive strain injury that makes it painful to use a mouse and to
        type for extended periods of time. Though it took considerable research,
        time, and commitment to learn, he is able to work with less pain using
        the following modifications to his work environment:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>use of an ergonomic keyboard</li>
        <li>use of keyboard commands without a mouse</li>
        <li>voice recognition software on his computer and mobile phone</li>
        <li>assistive touch on his mobile phone</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Alex encounters problems when websites and other online content cannot
        be navigated by keyboard commands alone. He frequently encounters web
        forms that do not have keyboard equivalents. Sometimes it is also
        difficult to skip content and navigate to sections on a webpage without
        using many keyboard commands, which is very tiring and limits the time
        he can spend working comfortably. He also recently began to explore the
        use of assistive touch on his mobile phone which also helps him use
        fewer gestures and work for longer periods of time. As a temporary fix,
        Alex’s employer has built several custom work arounds that provide
        keyboard support for his use of the company’s internal Content
        Management System with the intention to implement improved keyboard
        support to benefit all users on the next release of the software.

          Martine, online student som hører dårlig
        </a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Martine is 62 years old and has been hard of hearing since birth. She
        can hear some sounds, but not enough to understand speech. As a child
        she learned sign language and during her early school years learned
        written language. She is currently a student again, taking online
        college courses. The university she attends provides sign language
        interpreters and Communication Access Realtime Translation (CART)
        writers who provide written verbatim text interpreting of spoken
        language for her courses. However, Martine has encountered barriers when
        video and other media content are not captioned. The university became
        aware of the need and requirement to provide captioned media and
        transcripts for audio content and is now working with a captioning
        provider to caption all content posted on university websites, including
        all course content in learning management systems. In addition to
        providing access to the content for students who are deaf or hard of
        hearing, the university has found that the use of captions and
        transcripts has added benefits. Transcripts facilitate easier production
        of subtitles in a number of languages and also improve the indexing of
        online content. Improved indexing provides improved search engine
        optimization and improved discoverability of the university’s online
        content. The university follows WCAG guidelines in providing the
        captioned content.
